What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	$ git init
	Initialize an empty repository.
	No commit is created in the .git. It's empty. The existed files are labelled
	untracked. I have to create the 1st commit by myself.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is an intermediate between the working directory and the
	repository.
	$ git add file.txt
	add file to the staging area once a time.
	$ git reset wrong_file.txt
	remove the unwanted file from staging area. This file is still remaining in
	the working directory.
	Staging area provides a buffer for we to store files which could be in a single
	commit.
